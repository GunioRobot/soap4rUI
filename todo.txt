  -mouse over table highlight
  -create a quick driver to generate ruby tests
  -create a gui to do a visual diff of expected responses vs actual responses. 
  -google / amazon / ebay working examples 
done: 
  - add nillable to the attributes of each element
  - fix for nillable false minoccurs = 0
  - nil PromotionId, AppliedStatus, and QualifyType bugs. 
  - fix for booleans
  -submission bugs (soap faults should be displayed)
  - fix for errors requiring a restard due to chdir
  - upload feature
  - remove implicit .xml file extension
  -manually create and submit an xml
  -fix on restart of server having to go back to the method selector page.

  -(service name methods bug)
  -patch jruby openssl hex digit
  -patch jruby yaml load
  -run the app via jruby (collect all the gem dependencies)
  -store minoccurs maxoccurs in marshaller (alternative was to look it up at runtime from schemadef)
  -fix namespace issue for generated code with same name
  -save service descriptor locally so that tests are really unit tests.
  -add a button to save the response xml for later comparison 
  -the response should be displayed on the screen.
  -ui generate a ui that indents subelements correctly. 
  -convert from obj to xml and from xml to obj 
  -the submit button should gather all the inputs from the form and generate the request and send it to the server defined in the endpoint. 
  -optional fields should be marked as such
  -there should be a save button that allows you to store the request for later
  -there should be a load button to load a previously saved request.
  -the add button should send a request to the server and the response should reflect this change
  -map from soap4r object graph to form fields
  -translate from form fields and data to a soap4r object representing the tree.
  -fields that can occur more than once should have an "add field" button next to them to duplicate the input forms.  
  -create a default empty instance of a soap4r object from the wsdl
  -accept a local(saved on hard drive) or remote (http:) copy of the wsdl and give a drop down of all methods the service handles.
  -after selecting a method a web form should be generated according to the required and optional fields.
